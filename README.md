Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies:

    Java - Programming language for back-end logic.
    Maven - Build and dependency management tool for Java projects.
    JSP (JavaServer Pages) - Technology for generating dynamic content on the server side.
    HTML - Markup language for the structure of the web pages.
    CSS - Styling language for designing the layout and appearance of the web pages.
    JavaScript - For client-side interactivity.
    Bootstrap - CSS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web pages.

Features

    Dynamic Content Generation: JSP is used to dynamically generate HTML content based on user input and other data sources.
    Responsive Layout: The web application is fully responsive, thanks to Bootstrap, which adapts the UI for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    Interactive Elements: JavaScript provides the functionality for client-side interactivity like form validation, modals, dropdowns, etc.
    Well-structured and Modular: The project uses Maven for managing dependencies and building the project structure.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

    JDK 11 or above
    Apache Maven 3.6+
    A servlet container like Tomcat (version 9 or above is recommended)
    Git (optional, if you want to clone the project)

Steps to Set Up the Project

    Clone the Repository: If you have a GitHub repository, clone it to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository

Install Dependencies: Run the following Maven command to install all the required dependencies specified in the pom.xml file:

mvn clean install

Build the Project: To build the project, run the Maven build command:

    mvn clean package

    This will create a .war (Web Archive) file in the target directory. This file can be deployed to any servlet container like Apache Tomcat.

    Deploy to Tomcat:
        Copy the .war file from the target/ directory to the webapps/ directory of your Tomcat installation.
        Start Tomcat by running the startup.sh (Linux/Mac) or startup.bat (Windows) script from the Tomcat bin/ directory.
        Access the application by visiting http://localhost:8080/your-project-name/.

Running the Project Locally with Maven Plugin:

Alternatively, you can run the project directly from the command line using the Maven Tomcat Plugin. To do this, use the following command:

mvn tomcat7:run

This will start the Tomcat server locally and make your web app available at http://localhost:8080/.
Directory Structure


Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the following features:

    Homepage (index.jsp):
        Displays an overview of the project.
        Includes navigation to other pages.

    About Page (about.jsp):
        A simple page describing the project.

    Interactivity:
        JavaScript handles user interactions such as form validation, popups, and dynamic changes to the page.

    Styling:
        Bootstrap is used to style the application and ensure itâ€™s responsive on all devices.
